Three packages:
1. Saving
2. With offset
3. With offset & visa

1. Saving
Every year
	Every month
		At first day of each month, ie. day 1 
			- monthly_earning is added to saving_account
		Every day
			- daily_spendings* are calculated and reduced from saving_account
			- daily_interest is calculated from loan_amount and daily_interest_rate, and accumulated
		At last day of each month, ie. day 30
			- monthly_payment is reduced from saving_account
			- daily_interest that are accumulated into a monthly_interest is added to loan_amount
			- monthly_payment is reduced from loan_amount, meaning it has been paid off*
			
* daily_spendings is not an average of the overall spending over a period of time, rather a collection of spendings that are estimated to happening on the day.
* if monthly_interest is higher than monthly_payment, then this loan will never be paid off and enter an endless loop. Currently graph is set to show maximum up to 30 years.

2. With offset
Every year
	Every month
		At first day of each month, ie. day 1 
			- monthly_earning is added to offset_account*
		Every day
			- daily_spendings are calculated and reduced from offset_account*
			- daily_interest is calculated from loan_amount-offset_account and daily_interest_rate, and accumulated
		At last day of each month, ie. day 30
			- monthly_payment is reduced from offset_account
			- daily_interest that are accumulated into a monthly_interest is added to loan_amount
			- monthly_payment is reduced from loan_amount, meaning it has been paid off

* current offset_account cannot exceed current loan_amount. Any exceeding amount will be transferred to saving_account
* any amount of daily_spendings that is exceeding offset_account will be reduced from saving_account, this can happen at early stages of the loan, when there isn't much money in the offset_account and a big spending came up, eg a yearly insurance payment. However this can also indicate that monthly_spending and monthly_payment may be too much for the monthly_earning, then this loan will never be paid off.

3. With offset & visa
Every year
	Every month
		At first day of each month, ie. day 1 
			- monthly_earning is added to offset_account
		Every day
			- daily_spendings are calculated and reduced from visa_account*
			- daily_interest is calculated from loan_amount-offset_account and daily_interest_rate, and accumulated
		At last day of each month, ie. day 30
			- amount owing in visa_account is reduced from offset_account
			- monthly_payment is reduced from offset_account
			- daily_interest that are accumulated into a monthly_interest is added to loan_amount
			- monthly_payment is reduced from loan_amount, meaning it has been paid off
			
* purpose of visa_account: avoid the reduction of offset account from daily_spendings until the end of the month

* order of processes above are as mentioned.
